# AGENTS.md

## Current State

**Status:** Project initialization - gathering requirements

**Architecture:** TBD

**Key Files:** TBD

---

## Working Rules

1. **Git Usage:** We use git locally for version control.

2. **Commit After Each Phase:** We commit after completing each phase to create reasonable rollback points.

3. **Verify Each Phase:** Every phase includes verification steps. We confirm the phase works before moving on.

4. **Ask When Unsure:** If uncertain about a plan or task, ask for clarification rather than guess.

5. **Keep AGENTS.md Updated:** Update this file after each phase:
   - Update the "Current State" section at the top
   - Mark phase completion in the phases list
   - Another agent should be able to read this and understand the project state

6. **Detailed Commit Messages:** Write clear, descriptive commit messages that explain what was done and why.
